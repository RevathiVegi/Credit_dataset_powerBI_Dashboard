## KPIs
- I have displayed Bill amounts for each month, i.e. April to September as KPIs for easy comparison of bill amounts
  across these months at first glance
## Area chart
- Area chart is used to display defaulter trend based on marriage status. 
- In the given data, singles are the highest defaulters. 
- Also in the given data, there is a category '0' in marriage status. We need to decide if we 
	want to assign a category to '0'. Or may be combine them with 'Others'.
- In order to display defaulter to Age trend, I have created age bins of 5 year range. 20 to 25 age range seem to be
	the highest defaulters in the given data.
## Pie chart
- Pie chart is used to diplay defaulters to gender trend. 
- 60% female seem to be the highest defaulters in the given data.
## Tree Map
- A tree map visual is used to display defaulters based on education level. 
### Also each visual acts as a slicer. So that we can select a visual to see the trends in the other categories.
